       <h1>about</h1>
       <p>I live  in Somerville, MA, just outside of Boston.</p>
       <p>I develop open-source software.
          My current work is on the core team of the <a href="https://github.com/openedx">Open edX project</a>,
	  a learning management system (LMS) originally developed in 2011 for the
	  <a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/">MITx</a> and edX initiatives;
	  it is now used by thousands of education websites
	  and is self-governed by a global community of its of developers and users.
	  To faciliate the project's continued growth, my current focus is
	  modernization of the platform's backend and the strengthening of its developer APIs.
	  I enjoy programming language theory and advocate for the use of static typing,
	  immutability, and data-driven architecture as means of keeping complex codebases
	  coherent and stable (especially as LLM code generation becomes more common).
       </p>
       <p>I drum, in a variety of styles.
          My main project is <a href="https://bentluck.com">Bent Luck</a>,
	  an all-original pop-punk trio.
          I love creating music that makes people move, or think, or both.
	  I throw house shows and jam sessions when I can get away with it.
	  If you have an exciting idea for a record or event and want to collaborate, get in touch.
       </p>
       <p>I value complexity, intensity, novelty, and kindness.
          I am fortunate to be able to get around my community by bicycle and public transit,
	  and I care to ensure that others to have the ability to do that safely.
	  I participate in both <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective</a> and ineffective altruism.
	  I love sport climbing and can be frequently found at Bouldering Project Boston (say hi if you see me!).
