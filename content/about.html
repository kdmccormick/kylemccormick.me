       <h1>about</h1>
       <p>I live in Somerville, MA, just outside of Boston.</p>
       <p>I develop open-source software.
          My current work is on the core team of the <a href="https://github.com/openedx">Open edX project</a>,
	  a learning management system (LMS) originally developed for the 
	  <a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/">MITx</a> and edX initiatives,
	  now used by thousands of education websites
	  and self-governed by a global community of developers and users.
	  To faciliate the project's continued growth, my current focus is
	  modernization of the platform's backend and the strengthening of its developer APIs.
	  Before Open edX, I focused on formal verification and programming language translation;
	  from that experience, I've taken an appreciation for rich type systems, immutability, and
	  data-driven architecture, all of which I feel are key to keeping complex codebases
	  coherent and stable (especially as it becomes easier and easier to write new code quickly).
       </p>
       <p>I drum, in a variety of styles.
          My main project is <a href="https://bentluck.com">Bent Luck</a>, an all-original pop-punk trio,
	  and in the past I've performed in rock cover bands, jazz ensembles, and marching bands.
          I love creating music that makes people move, or think, or both.
	  I throw house shows and jam sessions when I can get away with it.
	  If you have an exciting idea for a record or event and want to collaborate, get in touch.
       </p>
       <p>I value complexity, challenge, novelty, and kindness.
          I am fortunate to be able to get around my community by bicycle and public transit,
	  I and care that others are able to do the same safely.
	  I participate in both <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective</a> and ineffective altruism.
          I enjoy programming language theory, mathematics, and philosophy,
	  and I particularly enjoy musing on what it means
	  to exist as willful agents in universe governed by deterministic physical laws.
	  I love sport climbing and can be frequently found at Bouldering Project Boston (say hi if you see me!).
